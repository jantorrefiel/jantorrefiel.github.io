    Dear Jana Torrefiel, <br> <br>
    
    <p> A wise man once said, 
        <i>"Each morning we are born again. What we do today is what matters most." - Buddha</i>" </p> 
    <p>
        So go, grab this day and live the hell out of it. Today, bad things may happen, you might not have a great day. But, </p>
        
    <p>that's okay. Tomorrow, you and your day will begin again. Today is actually a pretty good day. Look at you. You are </p>
        
    <p> amazing. Your smile is beautiful, and you brighten the lives of those around you. There is a fire within you. always </p>
        
    <p>remember to nurture the flame. Laugh. Love. Spread sunshine. Smile. Be fierce and fearless. Breathe. Be brave. Be </p>
        
        
    <p>strong. And seize the day. </p>
        
    <br> <br>    
    Love, <br>
        Carl Agura <br> </h3>
